# ABSTRACT: Dist::Zilla plugins used by Plicease
# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution contains some miscellaneous plugins that I use
that should probably not be of any use to anyone else.  Historically
they were used and included by my bundle C<[@Author::Plicease]>, but
I've separated them into their own distribution so they can be
installed without the the full set of prereqs required by the bundle.
